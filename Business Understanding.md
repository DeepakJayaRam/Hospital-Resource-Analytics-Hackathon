Business Understanding
1. Business Problem
Mid-sized multi-specialty hospitals in India operate under constant pressure to balance patient access, quality of care, and operational cost. Despite strong clinical capabilities, hospital administrators often lack real-time, consolidated visibility into how critical resources are being utilized across departments.
This results in the following operational challenges:
•	Inefficient Bed Utilization: Lack of real-time bed availability leads to artificial shortages, where patients wait despite beds being physically available due to delayed discharge processing.
•	Emergency Department Congestion: Overcrowding in emergency units is frequently caused by downstream bottlenecks, particularly delays in patient transfers to inpatient wards.
•	Unbalanced Staff Utilization: Static doctor and nursing schedules do not align with fluctuating patient volumes, causing staff burnout during peak hours and underutilization during off-peak periods.
•	Extended Discharge Turnaround Time: Delays between discharge approval and patient exit increase the Average Length of Stay (ALOS), impacting patient throughput.
•	Limited Cost Visibility: Absence of integrated cost and outcome data prevents identification of inefficiencies and proactive resource planning.
These challenges collectively increase operational costs, reduce patient satisfaction, and limit the hospital’s ability to scale efficiently.

2. Business Objectives
The objective of this analytics dashboard is to enable data-driven operational and strategic decision-making for hospital leadership. The solution aims to:
•	Optimize bed occupancy rates by providing real-time and predictive insights into admissions and discharges.
•	Reduce Average Length of Stay (ALOS) by identifying non-clinical discharge delays and care coordination gaps.
•	Minimize emergency department wait times through improved visibility into patient flow and resource availability.
•	Improve doctor and staff utilization by aligning workforce deployment with demand patterns.
•	Enhance patient outcomes and cost efficiency by tracking readmissions, treatment outcomes, and cost per patient.

3. Key Stakeholders
The dashboard is designed to support the following stakeholders:
•	Hospital Leadership (CEO / COO / CFO):
Require high-level KPIs, trends, and cost-performance indicators to support strategic planning and financial decisions.
•	Department Heads & Medical Directors:
Need department-level insights into resource utilization, patient throughput, and quality metrics to optimize clinical operations.
•	Operations & Nursing Managers:
Primary users who rely on near real-time data to manage staffing, bed turnover, and daily operational efficiency.
•	Admission & Discharge Coordinators:
Use patient flow insights to reduce wait times, improve discharge planning, and maximize bed availability.
